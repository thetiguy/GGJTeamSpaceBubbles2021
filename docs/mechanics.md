# Game Mechanics
## Character
- 6 Investigators, 1 Victim

### Specialization
- Terrain type that they are good at traversing
- 25% faster than normal time for location but gain 1 pt of exhaustion
### Exhaustion
- 1pt of exhaustion = 5% chance of death on assignment

## Terrain
- Named location setting style of terrain
- 6 different types corresponding to the investigators

## Location
- Should be 10 total, 6 chosen per level, randomly
- Each location should be a combination of 2 terrains eg Icy Cave - Ice, Stone

## Assignment
- Generated at level begin
- Contains one of the selected locations
- Generates a unique timer between .5 and 12 hrs

## Primary Game Loop
1. Victim delivers his current puzzle, and the time before the eldritch horrors catch up to him
1. Player character opens the Mystery App, reveals 6 locations to be explored and the length of time to investigate
1. Player selects an investigatort for each location - possible toggle to use specialization?
1. Player waits for clues to come in - set 15 minutes to 'tick' by at advanced speed, maybe option for realism mode - wait in real time
1. Player assembles clues and provides string to Victim containing solution to puzzle
1. Victim confirms puzzle solution and moves to next room

- As the Victim's timer counts down, his tension increases. The closer the player gets to 0 on the timer, the greater the chance the Victim tries something erratic and gets themself killed.
- The more exhausted the investigator gets, the higher their chance of dying. They should not immediately die, but die sometime along the assignment

## Messaging App
- Each tab contains txt messages from either an investigator or the victim.
- Messages are autogenerated from a list of messages, unless they die, in which case it would be from a preset death message
- The tab should also display their current stats, profile pic and a blurb about the character

## Map pane
- displays a hand drawn map of the tomb, to serve as a progression guide, fills in rooms as the Victim enters them

## Clue Pane
- filled in with the initial clues given by the Victim
- added to as investigators return with clues
- clicking on the link/button for each clue pops it into a window as if opening a file on a computer
- play buttons as necessary for videos or sound files
